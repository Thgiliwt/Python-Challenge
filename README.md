# Python-Challenge
This is the 3rd homework from my coding bootcamp course.
This week I was required to run python scripts to solve real world related tasks, one can often be seen within trading companies and the other is related to a semi election issue. Both of these two tasks are straight forword, the logic behind the pybank task is quite similar to the VBA challenge last week, where I need to iterate row by row to dig out the answers from existing integers, whereas the pyroll is more about counting and I need to have something new for it, the counter module. The codes are simple and easy to research and learn as there were not too many conditions to consider about. However to provide the same layout of the output from the given example were something took more time than I expected...

## Key Reflects

### Commits Frequency
It is required to have 20+ commits from the requirement but I only commit if I finished one day's work. It maybe nothing as the assignments are still, small scale to workplace tasks. We will see about it.

### Path (Relative Vs Absolute)
I firstly used os to open the raw data path, and applied absolute path methos when output the result to a textfile. During the class I have discussed the matter with the instructer about why it is necessary have a relative path. Now it is the answer, that when working as a group with a platform like github, everyone will need to use the main sturcture here, and everyone may have different paths on their local terminal. To make life eaiser, a relative path will be more appropriated.

### Simple Coding
This is something that I should spend more time on. In my script, there are some lines of code that, can be shortend or combined. As a starter, I am not able to do it everytime I start to type but I should keep it in mind, where and whenever I could, I should try it out.

### Researching
By far, I have spent a lot of time on searching some solutions from the websites about a typical issue. I have noiticed that I have improved in descripting my question, or what I would to find more precisely and the time spent on surfing online reduced greatly from last week assignment. These related to logic-related topics though. I have spent a lot in finding the right way to 'print' the outcomes to match the given example.

### Tools, Modules
During the work, I could often see people talking about new modules, add-ons etc. from the websites. Take Panda as an example, it seems like that it could solve the pyroll task so easy. I also imported 'counter' for the task and it has done a great job which save my time and line of coding a lot.

### Methods and codes abandonede
    #candidate_list = set()
    #candidate_list.add(row[2])
    #election = dict()

    #election["candidate"] = candidates_list
    #election["percentage"] = indiv_percent
    #election["vote"] = values_list
    
    #temp = '%(candidate)s, %(percentage)0.3f, (%(vote)i)'
